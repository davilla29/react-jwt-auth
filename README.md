# 🛡️ React Auth System (Frontend Only)

A frontend-only React application that implements user **registration**, **login**, and a **protected dashboard**, using JWT authentication from an external API.

## 📌 Description

This project demonstrates how to build an authentication flow in React using `axios` for API communication, `react-router-dom` for navigation, and `localStorage` for storing tokens and user information. No backend is included — all requests are sent to an external API.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ User registration with form input validation
- 🔐 Login functionality with JWT token handling
- 🔁 Navigation using `react-router-dom`
- 📦 Stores authentication token and user info in `localStorage`
- 📄 Protected dashboard that displays authenticated user details
- 🚪 Logout functionality
- ⚙️ Reusable Axios instance for API calls
- 📚 Clean use of React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useNavigate`
